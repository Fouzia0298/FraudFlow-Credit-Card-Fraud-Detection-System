# 🚀 FraudFlow-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-System 🔍💳
FraudFlow is a machine learning-based system designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It handles imbalanced data using SMOTE, trains a Random Forest model, and evaluates performance with precision, recall, and F1-score. Includes a user-friendly testing interface for real-time predictions.

## 📊 **Features**

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles imbalanced data using SMOTE and scales features for improved accuracy.
- **Model Training:** Implements **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** for fraud detection.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates performance using **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
- **User-Friendly Testing:** Provides a command-line interface (CLI) for real-time fraud detection.
